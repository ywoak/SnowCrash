Step 2 : Follow tcp stream
Step 3 : Print Data in ASCII (got ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L)
Step 4 : The . is because wireshark cant display the hex as ASCII char if they'rnt in the ASCII table, read every . they were all /177 (7f) which is DEL in man ascii, removed accordingly and found flag
Step 5 : ft_waNDReL0L is the new password to connect to flag02 and launch getflag
