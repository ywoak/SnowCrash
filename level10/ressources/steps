1: Reverse to understand binary, its a web client who uses the unprotected access() in C, its vulnerable to TOCTOU race condition so thats what we'll put in place
2: Create a webserver listening at the port the web client is sending data
3: Our goal is to let access validate a good file, then before it goes to open we replace our filename with a symlink to token so it will be read and sent to the server
4: Check the script included in this folder to further understand the logic behind the implementation of said exploit
