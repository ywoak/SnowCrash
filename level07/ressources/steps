reverse the binary to understand general control flow of the program ->
	Setuid/gid
	got content from env var LOGNAME
	Then sent it to asprintf with %s to write it to str
	Then printed it with system /bin/echo str
	So we needed str to evaluate to getflag since system was launching it
export LOGNAME=\`getflag\`
./level07
